    <h3>The Pirates of Penzance </h3>
    <h4>ACT-2</h4>
    <h5>Scene.-A ruined chapel by moonlight.  Aisles C., R. and L.,
        divided by pillars and arches, ruined Gothic windows at
        back.  MAJOR-GENERAL STANLEY discovered seated R.C.
        pensively, surrounded by his daughters.</h5>
    <p>GIRLS:    Oh, dry the glist'ning tear, etc.
    </p>
    <p>(FREDERIC enters)</p>
    <h6>MABEL:</h6>    <p>Oh, Frederic, cannot you, in the calm excellence of
        your wisdom, reconcile it with your conscience to say
        something that will relieve my father's sorrow?</p>
         <h6>FREDERIC:</h6>   <p>I will try, dear Mabel.  But why does he sit, night
            after night, in this draughty old ruin?</p>
            <h6> GENERAL: </h6>  <p> Why do I sit here?  To escape from the pirates'
                clutches, I described myself as an orphan; and, heaven
                help me, I am no orphan!  I come here to humble myself
                before the tombs of my ancestors, and to implore their
                pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
                escutcheon.</p>
                <h6>EDITH: </h6> <p>   Go and do your best endeavour,
                    And before all links we sever,
                    We will say farewell for-ever.
                         Go to glory and the grave!</p>
                         <h6>POLICE: </h6>   <p>(without moving)    Yes, yes, we go.
                          (PIRATE KING and RUTH appear at the window, armed.)</p>
                         <h6>KING: </h6> <p>  Young Frederic!  (Covering him with pistol)</p>
